<p>The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open internet protocol for business
    messaging. It defines a binary wire-level protocol that allows for the reliable exchange
    of business messages between two parties.
    AMQP has a layered architecture and the specification is organized as a set of parts that
    reflects that architecture. Part 1 defines the AMQP type system and encoding. Part 2 defines
    the AMQP transport layer, an efficient, binary, peer-to-peer protocol for transporting messages
    between two processes over a network. Part 3 defines the AMQP message format, with a
    concrete encoding. Part 4 defines how interactions can be grouped within atomic
    transactions. Part 5 defines the AMQP security layers.</p>
